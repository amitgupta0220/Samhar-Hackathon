# Samhar-Hackathon

#### Problem Faced

In order to ensure the safety of a region, it is necessary that troublemakers are monitored and each action must come into notice by the officers. Also, it is necessary to maintain social distancing and it is not possible for every store owners and police officers to continuously keep a track onto this. During this pandemic, it has been made compulsory to wear a mask whenever a person gets out of his/her house, but it has been seen that a lot of them do not obey this rule. Hence it is mandatory to keep a track of it for the safety of every citizen during the lockdown. To resolve this problem we are seeking to create a model which will detect and notify the concerned store owner or police officer of that locality and the necessary actions can be taken accordingly.
